					I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in
					the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

					“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
					transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
					free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks
					was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
					successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

				<blockquote class="short">
					Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them
					and learning from their experiences was easy.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote class="long">
					“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
					program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself
					as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
					attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”

				<blockquote class="short">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</blockquote>
				<blockquote class="long">
					“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
					professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
					former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
					curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
					for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
					the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
					during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job
					as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
