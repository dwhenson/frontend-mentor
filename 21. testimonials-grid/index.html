						weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
						successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

						“Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
						professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
						former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
						curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
						for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
						the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
						during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job
						as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
