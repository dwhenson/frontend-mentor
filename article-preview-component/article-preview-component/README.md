# Using the Sketch design file

Using this design file will help you practice building projects in the same way professionals do. Seeing the details in the design will help you improve your accuracy when building your projects.

## Don't have Sketch?

No problem! If you don't have [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), we've got a couple of other options that will let you use the file for free.

Sketch is compatible with most other popular design tools like Figma and Adobe XD. This makes it easy to import into your preferred tool and use as you wish!

To find out how to do this, [read our guide for importing Sketch files into other design tools](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/importing-sketch-files-into-other-design-tools-ca4ac85df8aa).

We hope you enjoy the challenge!
