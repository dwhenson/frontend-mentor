<h1 id="frontend-mentor">frontend-mentor</h1>

<p>Projects and challenges from <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io">Frontend Mentor</a> that are designed to help me improve my website development skills by building components, pages and websites.</p>

<p>I aim to to do this using semantic and accessiable HTML, efficent CSS, and JavaScript when necessary.</p>

<p>Each folder is a different challenge. The readme file in each folder explains the specifications required, key lessons learnt, relevent code tips and snippets, and useful links .</p>

<p>Solutions are also at <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/DqgQVJ">codepen</a>.</p>
