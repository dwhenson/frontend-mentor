# Frontend Mentor - Interactive pricing component

![Design preview for the Interactive pricing component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers (details provided below)

## Lessons Learnt

ðŸ’¡ Custom styling HTML elements is difficult and hard to get right - and it takes time. I also need to consider how to include keyboard and screen reader users from the planning stage.

## Code Tips

ðŸ—’ It is possible to change the styles on one element when another element is interacted with using the relationship between the elements. In this case I changed the styles on the toggle pill when when of the sibling `inputs` was hovered over.

```
#annually:hover ~ .toggle-styles {
	background-color: var(--clr-primary-200);
}
```
