<h2 id="thechallenge">The challenge</h2>

<p>Users should be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device&#8217;s screen size</li>
<li>Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard</li>
<li><strong>Bonus</strong>: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lessonslearnt">Lessons Learnt</h2>

<p>ðŸ’¡ Look the the functionality of the component without considering how it looks to identify the most appropriate HTML to use. (For example, this toggle is better as a radio button).<br/>
ðŸ’¡ I think this could be done without JS using a <code>monthly:checked ~ .price</code> or <code>monthly:checked &gt; .price</code> selectors, but this would require a massive code restructure. Again better planning from the outset might have enabled me to do this.<br/></p>

<h2 id="codetips">Code Tips</h2>

<p>ðŸ—’ Creating an &#8220;pop-out&#8221; element as shown in the middle pricing plan can be done by simply adding some extra padding. If the &#8220;smaller&#8221; elements are in the same parent element this should have the desired effect.<br/></p>
