## Lessons Learnt and Future Development

ðŸ’¡ More planning from the outset is needed to consider a11y and interactions, and the impacts that this will have on the HTML structure. Trying to adapt the HTML at a later stage is complicated and forces me down a track. I also need to learn SCSS and JavaScript modules to enable better code organisation

ðŸ’¡ I need a specific strategy to provide the 'hook' between HTML and JavaScript for DOM manipulation. Near the end of this challenge I got the advice to use the `data-` attributes for this. I tested this and it seemed to work really well. Combined with the convention of prefixing a class name with `js-` when added by JavaScipt will help make things clearer.

## Useful Resources

ðŸ”— Top plugin recommendations include: Micromodal.js [a lightweight, configurable and a11y-enabled modal library](https://micromodal.now.sh/) and [A11y Dialog](https://micromodal.now.sh/) from Kitty Giraudel. I didn't use a plugin this time around but might in future.

ðŸ”— I basically followed this approach from [A11y Casts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS68faEUduk&list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g&index=30). I didn't trap focus, but [this helper function](https://piccalil.li/quick-tip/load-all-focusable-elements-with-javascript) from Andy Bell would make this not too difficult.
