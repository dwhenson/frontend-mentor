# frontend-mentor
Projects and challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) that are designed to help me improve my website development skills by building components, pages and websites. 

I aim to to do this using semantic and accessiable HTML, efficent CSS, and JavaScript when necessary.

Each folder is a different challenge. The readme file in each folder explains the specifications required, key lessons learnt, relevent code tips and snippets, and useful links . 

Solutions are also at [codepen](https://codepen.io/collection/DqgQVJ).
